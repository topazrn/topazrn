### About Me
Hi Iâ€™m Topaz, a student and a junior software engineer. I started learning to code when I was about 13 years old. My middle school was very ambitious about olympics. My senior taught me a little bit of the pascal programming language after I begged him because I wanted to win some medals in OSN Komputer (I didn't get any XD). From there I moved on to Java and was able to pass my college assignments and exams relatively easily. Currently I am studying and working in Binus University.

I love working with Laravel (PHP) and Sapper (TypeScript), but currently I'm adventuring in the C# world. I'm passionate about programming and believe that learning never stops.
