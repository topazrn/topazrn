### About Me
Hi I’m Topaz, a student and a junior software engineer. I started learning to code when I was about 13 years old. My middle school was very ambitious about olympics. My senior taught me a little bit of pascal after I begged him because I wanted to win some medals (I didn't get any XD). From there I moved on to Java and was able to pass my college exams relatively easily. Currently I am studying and working in Binus University.

I love working with Laravel and Sapper. I'm passionate about programming and believe that learning never stops.
